Data-Driven-Cyclistic-analysis

This is a data analysis project focused on understanding how different users (members vs casual riders) use Cyclistic’s bike-sharing service in Chicago. The goal is to explore ride trends, user behavior, and give insights that can help the company increase memberships.

The analysis is done in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and covers data cleaning, ride pattern analysis, and visualizations like ride duration, time-of-day trends, and bike type usage.
